# NN-expt
## Artificial neural network experiments

Collection of experiments and practices in artificial neural network.

Run `venv.sh` in each subdirectory to guarantee the environment in each subdirectory. For example, in `NN-expt/PairShift`, run `venv.sh` then run `source python-env/bin/activate` before working on / running codes.
